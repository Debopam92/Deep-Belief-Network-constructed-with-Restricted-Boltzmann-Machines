# Deep-Belief-Network-constructed-with-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machines
The experiments were performed on MNIST digit recognition dataset and the CIFAR dataset.
Through this project studies have been done on how probabilistic models can be used for learning from data, also how a Deep Belief Network can be implemented without back propagation, experienced Theano making the code for deep learning less rigorous. However these networks take a long time to learn the data and requires high performance systems.
